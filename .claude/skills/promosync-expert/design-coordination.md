# Design Coordination: PromoSync + Shopify MCP + Design Tools

This skill is a **PromoSync expert**. It coordinates with two other capabilities:

1. **Shopify MCP / Shopify docs** — for platform-level knowledge (Liquid filters, theme architecture, section schemas, Shopify Function API, cart attributes).
2. **Design tools (nano banana pro, Figma, Midjourney, etc.)** — for visual mockups.

The goal: a user should be able to say *"Design me a beautiful product page for our PromoSync-powered store"* and end up with mockups that already reflect the real data shapes and states.

```

Your role (as this skill): translate PromoSync's **data reality** into **design constraints** the design tool can work with, then later translate the mockup back into working theme code that reads the actual metafields.

---

## Step 1 — Build the design brief before calling the design tool

Before asking nano banana pro for a mockup, produce a **short, structured brief** that encodes:

- **Component purpose** (e.g., "tier pricing table for product page")
- **Data shape** (from `metafields.md` — paste the relevant JSON example)
- **States to render** (empty, 1 tier, 3 tiers, 5 tiers, matched tier highlighted, variant switching)
- **Copy patterns** (how numbers are formatted, currency, plural/singular)
- **Constraints** (mobile-first, fits alongside native Shopify variant picker, must not duplicate Shopify's native `quantity_price_breaks` UI)
- **Theme context** (this theme is based on Trade v15 — reuse existing design language: `color-{{ color_scheme }}`, `.gradient`, `.product__info-wrapper` spacing, accordion component, price component)

### Brief template

```
COMPONENT: <name>
PLACEMENT: <page type> — <position relative to other components>

DATA (from PromoSync):
  <metafield path>
  Shape:
    <paste JSON example from metafields.md>
  Notes:
    - <critical rule, e.g. "price in cents">
    - <tier match rule, etc.>

STATES TO DESIGN:
  1. Empty (no data) — <behavior>
  2. Single tier / flat — <behavior>
  3. Multiple tiers / typical — <behavior>
  4. Active/selected state — <behavior>
  5. Variant switch — <transition behavior>

COPY:
  - <exact labels>
  - <pluralization rules>
  - <fallback text>

CONSTRAINTS:
  - Mobile-first (320px → 768px → 1024px)
  - Matches Trade theme design language (see theme.liquid settings)
  - Respects color-scheme CSS variables
  - WCAG AA contrast
  - No conflict with native Shopify <quantity-price-breaks> component

OUT OF SCOPE:
  - Checkout discount UI (applied by Shopify Function, not theme)
  - <anything else>
```

---

## Step 2 — Prompt templates for nano banana pro

Paste one of these after filling in the brief. Keep prompts concrete: specific data values, specific dimensions, specific color tokens.

### Tier pricing table (product page)

```
Design a volume pricing table for a Shopify product page.

DATA (real metafield from PromoSync):
  [
    { "quantityMin": 1,   "price": 2500 },
    { "quantityMin": 10,  "price": 2200 },
    { "quantityMin": 25,  "price": 2000 },
    { "quantityMin": 50,  "price": 1800 },
    { "quantityMin": 100, "price": 1500 }
  ]
  (price is in cents — render as dollars: $25.00, $22.00, $20.00, $18.00, $15.00)

LAYOUTS REQUIRED:
  1. Compact horizontal strip (≤768px width) — 2–3 visible tiers, overflow scrolls
  2. Full table (≥768px) — all tiers, columns: Qty, Price, Save
  3. Collapsible (accordion) variant for use in sidebar

STATES:
  - Default: current tier (based on qty input) highlighted with accent color
  - Hover: row brightens
  - Switching variant: brief fade transition

STYLE:
  - Aesthetic: clean, modern, minimal — matches Shopify Trade theme
  - Typography: sans-serif, similar to Inter or system stack
  - Accent color: customer brand blue (placeholder #2563eb)
  - Corners: 8px radius
  - Spacing: generous padding inside cells

OUTPUT: 3 variants showing all three layouts, each in light + dark mode.
```

### Location/decoration selector (product page)

```
Design a decoration selector UI for a promotional product page.

DATA (real metafield from PromoSync):
  [
    { "locationName": "Front Chest",
      "decorations": [
        { "decorationName": "Screen Print", "maxImprintColors": 10, "default": true, "priceIncludes": true },
        { "decorationName": "Embroidery",   "maxImprintColors": 6,  "default": false, "priceIncludes": false }
      ]},
    { "locationName": "Back",
      "decorations": [
        { "decorationName": "Screen Print", "maxImprintColors": 10, "default": true, "priceIncludes": true }
      ]}
  ]

UX:
  - Two cascading dropdowns: "Decoration location" → "Decoration method"
  - Second dropdown is disabled until first is chosen
  - Method options show "— included" or "— additional charge" based on priceIncludes
  - Method options show "(up to N colors)" where maxImprintColors is set
  - Default-selected method when a location has one

STATES:
  1. Initial (nothing selected, method disabled)
  2. Location chosen, methods populated, default pre-selected
  3. Different location chosen (methods re-populate)

CONSTRAINTS:
  - Sits between variant picker and quantity input
  - ≤600px wide on desktop, full width on mobile
  - Labels clearly required
  - Keyboard-accessible

OUTPUT: One mobile + one desktop mockup for each state.
```

### Minimum quantity notice

```
Design an inline minimum quantity notice for a product page.

DATA: product.metafields.psrestful.minimum_quantity = 25

PLACEMENT: Immediately above the quantity input, below the price.

COPY: "Minimum order: 25 units" — support singular "1 unit" too.

STATES:
  1. Passive notice (min met or not yet interacted)
  2. Error flash (user tried qty below min) — inline error in same spot

STYLE: subtle (gray text + info icon) by default, error state uses warning color.
```

### Volume pricing callout / teaser

```
Design a "Save more in bulk" teaser block for a Shopify product page.

PURPOSE: encourage customers to scroll to the tier pricing table.

DATA INPUT: variant has 3+ tiers in psrestful.part_price_array.
  Compute: "Save up to X% when you buy N or more"
  Example from real data:
    tiers = [1:$25, 10:$22, 25:$20, 50:$18, 100:$15]
    → "Save up to 40% when you buy 100 or more"

STATES:
  1. Has tiers (teaser visible)
  2. No tiers (component hidden)

STYLE: Small horizontal card, accent background, right-pointing CTA.
```

## Step 3 — Translating mockups back to Liquid

After the design is approved, come back to this skill + Shopify MCP and:

1. **Identify the data reads** — which metafields does the mockup need? Check `metafields.md`.
2. **Pick the implementation path** — is there an existing PromoSync theme app block (`theme-blocks.md`) that can be configured to match, or do you need custom Liquid?
3. **If custom:** base the implementation on `integration-patterns.md` and existing theme files. Reuse theme design tokens (`color-{{ color_scheme }}`, existing component CSS) rather than inventing new ones.
4. **Use Shopify MCP** for platform-specific questions (correct Liquid filter for a use case, section schema for settings, event names for variant change).
5. **Run `shopify theme check`** and test in dev (`shopify theme dev`) before reporting done.

---

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Designing before confirming data shape.** Always paste the JSON example from `metafields.md` into the brief. Designers inventing field names leads to mockups that can't be built.
- **Ignoring cents.** Nano banana pro will happily produce `$2500` instead of `$25.00`. The brief must call out "price in cents, render as dollars."
- **Designing the discount.** The theme never applies the discount — the Shopify Function does at checkout. Don't spend design time on discount badges at checkout; focus on the cart preview.
- **Duplicating native Shopify UI.** Shopify has a native `<quantity-price-breaks>` component. Fall back to PromoSync data only when native is empty (see `integration-patterns.md` — "Volume pricing popover").
- **Forgetting the empty state.** Many products won't have tiers/decorations. Every brief must include an empty/absent state.

## Quick decision tree

```
User wants a PromoSync-aware UI component.
│
├── Does PromoSync already provide a theme app block for this?
│   └── YES → Recommend configuring the block (theme-blocks.md). Design is for skinning only.
│   └── NO  → Continue ↓
│
├── Is the data already in a PromoSync metafield?
│   └── YES → Reference metafields.md; write a brief with the real JSON shape.
│   └── NO  → Data gap. Surface this to the user — they may need a PromoSync app change, not a theme change.
│
├── Ask design tool for mockups using the brief + prompt template.
│
└── Translate mockup → Liquid using integration-patterns.md + Shopify MCP for platform details.
